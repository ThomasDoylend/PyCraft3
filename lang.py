Welcome to PyCraft: Survival of the Fittest!
You will be pitted against each other in a virtual
battle. This is not just a matter of skill, however.
While you are not allowed to build or destroy blocks,
you can still use doors, hatches, and TNT.

Keep in mind that wildly shooting at your oppenent is not
a good idea: you have limited ammo. However, when you are
creating your battle zone with vanilla PyCraft, you will
notice a new block marked 'Ammo.' In PyCraft SOTF this block
acts as a powerup, giving you more ammo.

Don't be worried if the game pauses for a moment; the
other player is probably just setting off some TNT right
under you!

Have a blast!!! (Har Har Har)"""
