# PyCraft 3
Voxel sandbox in Python. Has ~40 types of blocks.

I wrote this a few years back. Feel free to do whatever you want with it. You will need Python 2, PyGame, PyOpenGL, and EasyGUI.

This code is under semi-active development: I will be cleaning up code occasionally, and sometimes adding new blocks or testing stuff out.
